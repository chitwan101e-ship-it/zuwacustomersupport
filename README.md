## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tool |
|-------|------|
| Frontend | Next.js 15 (App Router, TypeScript) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Backend / DB | Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Realtime) |
| Email / OTP | Resend |
| Deployment | Vercel |

## Architecture

### Subdomain routing

Every business gets a subdomain: `slug.jbcoms.com`

```
ht.jbcoms.com        → Business "HT" public page
acmecorp.jbcoms.com  → Business "Acme Corp" public page
jbcoms.com           → Main platform (sign up, feed, dashboard)
```

The `src/middleware.ts` file intercepts subdomain requests and rewrites them to `/business/[slug]/...` — Next.js handles them as normal App Router pages.

### User roles

| Role | Sub-role | Can do |
|------|----------|--------|
| Customer | — | Browse feed, react, comment, message businesses |
| Business | Admin (1 per biz) | Post announcements, manage team, reply to messages |
| Business | Support (max 4) | Reply to customer messages |

## Setup

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/you/jbcoms.git
cd jbcoms
npm install
```

### 2. Create a Supabase project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) → New project
2. Open **Database → SQL Editor**
3. Paste & run the entire contents of `supabase/schema.sql`
4. In **Database → Replication**, enable Realtime for:
   - `messages`
   - `conversations`
   - `announcements`

### 3. Create a Resend account

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) → Sign up
2. Add your domain `jbcoms.com` and verify DNS records
3. Create an API key

### 4. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Fill in `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...

RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@jbcoms.com

NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_DOMAIN=jbcoms.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://jbcoms.com
```

### 5. Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

**Testing subdomains locally:**

Add entries to `/etc/hosts`:
```
127.0.0.1  localhost
127.0.0.1  ht.localhost
127.0.0.1  acmecorp.localhost
```

Then visit `http://ht.localhost:3000` — middleware will detect the subdomain.

## Deployment (Vercel)

### 1. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

Or connect your GitHub repo in the Vercel dashboard.

### 2. Add environment variables

In Vercel project settings → Environment Variables, add all vars from `.env.local`.

### 3. Configure wildcard subdomain

In Vercel project settings → Domains:
1. Add `jbcoms.com` (root domain)
2. Add `*.jbcoms.com` (wildcard — requires Pro plan or higher)

In your DNS provider (Cloudflare recommended):
```
Type  Name   Value
A     @      76.76.21.21      (Vercel IP)
CNAME *      cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### 4. Update Supabase Auth

In Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration:
- Site URL: `https://jbcoms.com`
- Redirect URLs: `https://jbcoms.com/**`, `https://*.jbcoms.com/**`
